DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network
management protocol used to dynamically assign an Internet Protocol (IP) address to any
device, or node, on a network so they can communicate using IP. DHCP automates and
centrally manages these configurations rather than requiring network administrators to
manually assign IP addresses to all network devices. DHCP can be implemented on small
local networks, as well as large enterprise networks.
